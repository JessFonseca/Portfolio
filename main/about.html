                <p>My name is Jesse Fonseca. Computers and technology in general have always been fascinating and made we wonder
                    how every works behind the scenes. This fascination led to gaining knowledge about technologies and through
                    that knowledge came skills. This fascination was a huge factor in finally obtaining a Bachelor's degree
                    for Computer Engineering in May of 2018. I wish to continue learning more and in the process hope to
                    obtain more knowledge about the world around us.</p>
